DISEQUI  ·  THE SHADOW STUDIO
“We work in half‑light where ideas learn to breathe.”

—

You, funded founder, sit at **T‑minus‑18 months**.
The wire hit, the celebratory Slack emoji has scrolled out of view,
and the cap table now whispers: *Show results or vanish.*

Your burn is ticking, your backlog looks like spilled spaghetti,
and investors only smile when you email actual traction graphs.

*Hi. We’re Disequi.*

We are the **architects of investable growth for capital‑backed rebels**—
the off‑screen crew who drag plots from “so it goes” to “so it grows.”
Picture Vonnegut’s friendly ghost on the fire escape: handing you tools
while the building smolders, joking about entropy, then mapping the exit
that turns into a metrics parade.

### CHAPTER 1 — UNSTUCK
> “Minus‑one to zero before the espresso cools.”

We laser the real bottleneck—market, product, or message—then flip it.
Code or no‑code, AI or elbow grease: whatever crushes inertia fastest.

### CHAPTER 2 — THE ANTI‑PLAYBOOK
Developers **hate** funnels.
Investors **love** traction math.
Everyone says you must choose.
**We translate.**

### CHAPTER 3 — FRACTIONAL FIREPOWER
Pick any two, swap later, pay only for brains in use:
**● Growth  ● Product  ● Marketing  ● R&D  ● Research**
(Collect the whole set once Series A is in sight.)

### CHAPTER 4 — MONEY TALKS, WE DON’T
Sworn to secrecy. NDA at hello. No public trophies, no logos,
just new J‑curves and the quiet thud of shareholder updates landing on time.

### CHAPTER 5 — THE CHEATCODE
Clock’s loud? Tilt gravity.
